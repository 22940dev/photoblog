The sound of a broom whisking over concrete pulled me from sleep.
I slid one leg out from under a wool blanket and checked my watch; 6:53 AM.
Peering through the tinted camper shell window I saw a hotel employee sweeping
litter into a dustpan. I waited until he was a few parking spaces away
before climbing out of last night's accommodation. 
I don't always sleep in the back of friends' trucks, in hotel parking lots,
but when I do it's after a wedding. I snagged a cup of orange
juice from the lobby and drove to Seattle.

One failed nap attempt and half hour later I was back on the road, this time to Index,
Washington. Some friends who made the trip up for the wedding planned a few extra 
days for rock climbing, and I can't pass up a good climbing opportunity.

Summer days in Washington seem to last forever, and combined with the commanding 
landscape of the Cascades it's easy to forget everything else. I'm left with warm memories of 
towering granite walls, sore hands, dirty feet, 
and less-warm, but breathtakingly refreshing dips in mountain rivers.

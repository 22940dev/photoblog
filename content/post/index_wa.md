The sound of a broom whisking over concrete pulled me from sleep.
I slid one leg out from under a wool blanket and checked my watch; 6:53 AM.
Peering through the tinted camper shell window I saw a hotel employee sweeping
litter into a dustpan and waited until he was a few parking spaces away
before climbing out of last night's accommodation. 
I don't always sleep in the back of friends' trucks in hotel parking lots,
but when I do it's after a wedding. I snagged a cup of orange
juice from the continental breakfast spread in the lobby and drove 
back to Seattle.

One failed nap attempt and half hour later I was invited to join a few friends 
in Index, Washington. They'd made the trip to Seattle for the wedding but wisely
planned a few extra days of rock climbing, so, without missing a beat (or changing clothes)
 I loaded up the car and left.

For the next three days time stood still. Summer days in Washington
seem to last forever, and combined with the commanding landscape of
the Cascades it's easy to forget everything else. I'm left with warm memories of 
golden-light filled forests, towering granite walls, sore hands, dirty feet, 
and the less-warm, but breathtakingly refreshing dips in mountain rivers.

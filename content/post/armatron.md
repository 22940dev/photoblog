I woke before sunrise and hiked a twisting trail through dark desert terrain, 
arriving at a deep canyon still harboring the few remaining patches of last winterâ€™s snow. 
We approached the base of the wall and began to climb the towering and unapologetically-cold sandstone. 
Hours blurred together navigating wrinkles, ledges, and cracks, methodically ascending the canyon's
northern face.

I tied in to an anchor a few hundred feet from the top as the
sun broke from behind. Slowly, rotating clockwise I peeled my chest from the wall while
carefully smearing the rubber of my heels across a sloping shelf below. 
As I pressed my back into the cold varnished stone a wave of brilliant morning light 
subsumed, what felt like at the time, the entire world.

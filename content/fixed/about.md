  Hi, this is the personal weblog of <b>Ben Woodward</b>.
</p>
<p>
  I was born and raised in Alaska and currently reside in Seattle, Washington,
  by way of a small town in Idaho and a lot of international travel. 
  I enjoy the outdoors, photography, reading, rock climbing, and building software.

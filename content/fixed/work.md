    In 2009 I joined my first startup. Founded by 3 Vulcan engineers, <a
href="http://tritontechnical.com">Triton Technical</a> setout to provide the 
standard in highend AV/IT systems for mega yachts. I leveraged my formal 
education in Audio Engineering to help build and commission these custom solutions. 
Initially a hardware-focused role, by the end of 2011 my primary focus had shifted to software and I 
transitioned into a fulltime software position around the fall of 2012. In this
new role I designed and developed software to control and automate disparate systems (HVAC, lighting,
sound, tv, navigation, etc), through a variety of methods (IP, serial, relay, IR, etc) 
from a single, cross platform interface (early generation iPads, web browsers,
custom touchpanels, etc). Throughout this time I traveled all over the world
to deploy and commission the systems at a whirlwind pace. I was lucky enough
to visit many prominant European, Middle Eastern, and South American cities, 
as well as countless sleepy coastal towns, warm tropical villages, and freezing, 
snow covered cities.

    Toward the end of 2013, with nearly a full passport, I began looking for a
 change of pace. I joined an early stage technology startup, <a href="www.gratafy.com">Gratafy</a>, 
and focused on growing and refining my craft. As one of the first engineering hires
at a rapidly growing ecommerce company, I worked on everything 
from custom payment integrations on ancient point-of-sale terminals, configuring
and operationalizing a build system and CI pipeline, operating and developing a microservices 
architecture, building a handful of ambitious single page webapps, and just 
about everything inbetween. This work has enabled the company to call some of
the largest brands in the world clients, and the largest technology companies in
the world partners.
